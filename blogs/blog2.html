        <h2>By reading the above Title you may think that how it's possible to live in Mumbai without worry about the money or is he even giving the right information.</h2>
        <p> But no it's true that you can you live in mumbai very cheaply  without woory about the  money. But the question here is : <b>Is is possible for everyone ?</b>
        The answer to the question in no. This is not for everyone otherwise everyone in this would have came to mumbai to live.
        You need to be a Student to get this Facility. I will tell how you can get this Facility and not to worry about the money in This Blog. </p>
        <p>As a student  when you come to Mumbai for higher educatin the main question arrises that how will you live in this city where everything is so expensive.
            But here Government of Maharashtra provide so many Government Hostels for the students who come from different States 
            and also from the ones who come from different districts. This Hostels are totally free. They take care about your Food cost , Your Travel Expensives 
            and also they take about you Stationaries , You College Trip cost too. In total they take 
            care about your entier cost of living. 
        <p>As this Hostels are providing so much things for students but there is criteria to get
            addimision in this Hostels. Every year addimision starts at mid june and the result 
       are decalared at August End. But the main
     problem here is getting into this Hostels in as difficult as getting into the good Colleges.
    As there are very limited sits get avialable every Year So to get into this List you need to have Good Percentage.
    So getting into this hospital is little difficult but if you get selected into one of those 
    it will so easy for you to live in Mumbai without worry about the money too much.
    
    <p><strong>The next question arrise is where are those Hostels ?</strong>
    Students always think about that there Hostels should be inside the campus or at least nearby the colloge.
   This issue is also taken care  by the Government og Maharashtra. There are diffirent Hostels at 
different locations. So you don't need to worry about the locations of the Hostels.</p>
